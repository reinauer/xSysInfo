xSysInfo is an Open Source system information program for 68k-based classic
Amigas, and is an homage to the (in)famous and ubiquitous SysInfo program.

Additional features above and beyond SysInfo include:
- Memory benchmarking.  The tool now performs memory speed tests and reports
  bandwidth in MB/s, giving you a much clearer picture of your system's
  performance. It also includes refreshed baselines for reference systems to
  make comparisons more accurate.
- Accurate Floppy and Hard Disk performance.  No more overflow values of
  6,553,600 Bytes/sec.
